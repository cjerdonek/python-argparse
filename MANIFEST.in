# This file specifies what non-default files to include in a
# source distribution (i.e. a *.tar.gz file generated by running
# `python setup.py sdist`.)
#
# We use the Python package `check-manifest` to validate that this file
# is correct.
#
# The following files get included automatically, so there is no need
# to include them explicitly (there may be ):
#
#   MANIFEST.in
#   setup.py
#

include .travis.yml
include LICENSE
include README.md
include CHANGELOG.md
